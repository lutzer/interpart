No need to build this dir, since the most current production build is in modules/server/www

## Development

* run `npm install`
* run `npm install gulp-cli -g`

* serve app by running: `npm run watch`, you need to have the server 
running at the same time by running `npm rum watch` in the modules/server dir
* deploy app to modules/server/www with `npm run deploy`.
